/**
 * reactive/arrayTraps -- Array mutation interception via Proxy.
 *
 * When scope.items is an array, we return a Proxy that intercepts mutating
 * methods (push, pop, splice, etc.). Each mutation:
 * 1. Clones the current array
 * 2. Applies the mutation to the clone
 * 3. Commits the new array via the commit callback
 *
 * Non-mutating methods (map, filter, forEach, etc.) pass through to the
 * current array snapshot without interception.
 *
 * The original array in state is NEVER mutated directly -- all writes go
 * through the commit callback which calls setValue/updateValue.
 */

 * @param commit - Called with the new array after a mutation (triggers setValue)
